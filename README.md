# SoftwareEng-Ex1

The project is about an undirected graph with function on it.

The graph's format is:

number of nodes

number of edges

node_i, node_j, weight

node_i, node_j, weight….

The functions we are doing on the graph are:

*Find the minimum cost between two point in the graph (in addition a black list of vertex that you can move thourth them).

*Find Diameter and Radius of the graph.

*Check if the graph satisfy the Triangle inequality.

we added a format of a test in this way: 

number of queries

ni, nj, BL number , n_first … n_last

in our project we used the open source:  http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/
